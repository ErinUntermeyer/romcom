Erin Untermeyer and Brigette Doelp Pair-Project Mod 1

## Objective

* Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data
* Use a provided class by creating object instances using the `new` keyword
* Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
* Understand event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements
* Begin to understand how to write effective, clean HTML & CSS

## Overview

People say that romance novels are formulaic. Well ... maybe that's true. We're going to make an app that generates romance novel covers!

## Timeline

Our focus is on complete understanding of the code we write and implementation of concepts. We agreed after each iteration we would make an effort to refactor so we can submit clean, DRY code. Below is our progression as the project advanced.

## Progression

* 5/12/2020 - Wrote the DTR, made rough timeline, reviewed project goals and rubric.
* 5/13/2020 - Reviewed Iteration 0, completed pseudocode, wrote skeleton for Random Cover function, listed takeaways for independent research.
* 5/14/2020 - Discussed research, created variables to access HTML, wrote an event listener for page load, wrote functions to generate random cover. At this point, we required more research to get function working. Made list of takeaways for independent research.
* 5/15/2020 - Removed event listener as it was not needed. Got random cover on page load working. Enabled "Show New Random Cover" button by moving variables created to generate random cover from global variables to inside the display cover function. Reviewed Iteration 2 and made list of takeaways for independent research.
* 5/16/2020 - Created more variables to access HTML, added event listener, wrote function to toggle from home view to form page. Made further progress with enabling page navigation. Came up with two solutions for enable all buttons and independently researched each.
* 5/17/2020 - Updated README, reviewed DTR. Discussed independent research and agreed to do some more prior to next meeting to complete Iteration 2.
* 5/18/2020 - Completed and debugged all button functions, completing Iteration 2. Continuing, we enabled the 'Create Your Own Cover' feature, finishing out Iteration 3.
* 5/19/2020 - Removed comments in code, as well as reorganized code to improve readability. Confirmed that both partners have full understand of all code written, as well as completed the README.

## Resources

For this project we will use GitHub to manage workflow and Atom as our text editor. For resources we will use primarily MDN and stack overflow. We will make use of our mentors and classmates for feedback and understanding as well as use pseudocoding and the rubber duck method.

## Project Outcome

This website generates and creates new romance novel covers.

The first feature of the website is generating a new random cover at the click of a button. When you click the 'Show New Random Cover' button, a new cover will be generated for you.

The second feature of the website is allowing users to enter their own images and text to generate a custom cover.

Lastly, the buttons on the website navigate the user to the designated pages.
